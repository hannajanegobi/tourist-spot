        <h3>WILD DUCKS</h3>
        <p>BURAUEN, Leyte – The Mahagnao Volcano Natural Park (MVNP), the site known for lakes and thousands of wild ducks, has officially opened after more than two years of closure and limited operations due to Covid-19 pandemic.

The ecotourism site is the last of the seven protected areas in Eastern Visayas ready to welcome visitors again since the health crisis broke out, Crisostomo Badeo Jr., the MVNP protected area superintendent on Wednesday said.

“We have not rushed the reopening since the primary purpose is not to do business, but to preserve the natural wonders of Mahagnao. We have to make a lot of preparations,” Badeo said in an interview during the reopening of the site.</p>
